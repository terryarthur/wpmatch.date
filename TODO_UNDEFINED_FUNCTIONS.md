# WPMatch - Undefined Functions TODO List

## Status Legend: ❌ = Needs Fix | ✅ = Fixed | 🔍 = Under Review

## CRITICAL FIX: Translation Loading Error

### ✅ Early Translation Calls Fixed
**Issue**: Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called incorrectly
**Root Cause**: Translation functions called before text domain properly loaded
- PHP version check called `esc_html__()` too early
- WordPress version check called `esc_html__()` too early  
- Field type registry called translation functions in constructor

**Fix Applied**: ✅ FIXED
- Removed translation calls from early requirement checks
- Used plain English strings for requirement error messages
- Modified field type registry to delay translation-dependent registration until `init` hook
- Ensured all translation calls happen after text domain is loaded

Location: /wpmatch.php requirement checks + field type registry ✅ FIXED
Impact: Critical - WordPress notice about incorrect translation loading ✅ RESOLVED

## CRITICAL FIX: Memory Exhaustion Error

### ✅ Circular Dependency Fixed
**Issue**: PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size exhausted during plugin activation
**Root Cause**: Circular dependency in component initialization
- `wpmatch_plugin()` creates main instance
- `init_components()` creates field managers  
- Field managers call `wpmatch_plugin()->database` in constructor
- Creates infinite recursion loop

**Fix Applied**: ✅ FIXED
- Updated `WPMatch_Profile_Field_Manager` to accept database parameter
- Updated `WPMatch_Field_Groups_Manager` to accept database parameter  
- Updated `WPMatch_Interaction_Manager` to accept database parameter
- Modified `init_components()` to pass database instance directly
- Eliminated circular dependency

Location: /wpmatch.php init_components() method ✅ FIXED
Impact: Critical - Plugin activation fails ✅ RESOLVED

## 1. Missing Dependencies in wpmatch.php

### ✅ Missing Field-Related Classes  
The following classes are used but not loaded in wpmatch.php:

- class-profile-field-manager.php - Used in tests and admin ✅ FIXED
- class-field-type-registry.php - Used in tests and admin ✅ FIXED  
- class-field-validator.php - Used in tests and admin ✅ FIXED
- class-field-groups-manager.php - Used in tests and admin ✅ FIXED

Location: /wpmatch.php load_dependencies() method ✅ FIXED
Impact: High - Core field functionality will not work ✅ RESOLVED

### ✅ Missing Admin Profile Fields Class
- class-profile-fields-admin.php - Used but not loaded ✅ FIXED

Location: /wpmatch.php admin classes section ✅ FIXED
Impact: High - Admin field management will fail ✅ RESOLVED

## 2. Plugin Component Initialization Issues

### ✅ Missing Component Initialization
The following components need initialization in init_components():

- profile_field_manager ✅ FIXED
- field_type_registry ✅ FIXED
- field_validator ✅ FIXED
- field_groups_manager ✅ FIXED

Location: /wpmatch.php init_components() method ✅ FIXED
Impact: High - Components will be null when accessed ✅ RESOLVED

## 3. JavaScript Dependencies 

### ✅ Missing Nonce Setup
Admin JS references wpMatchAdminVars.nonce but variable may not be enqueued.

Location: Check enqueue_admin_scripts() method ✅ FIXED
Impact: Medium - AJAX calls will fail ✅ RESOLVED

### ✅ Script Path Issues
Profile fields admin script had incorrect path references ✅ FIXED

## 4. Database Dependencies

### ✅ Database Initialization Order
Classes depending on wpmatch_plugin()->database may fail if not initialized first.

Files affected:
- class-profile-field-manager.php ✅ VERIFIED OK
- class-field-groups-manager.php ✅ VERIFIED OK
- class-interaction-manager.php ✅ VERIFIED OK

Impact: Medium - Runtime errors when accessing database ✅ RESOLVED

## Fix Priority:

1. ✅ CRITICAL: Fix early translation loading causing WordPress notices
2. ✅ CRITICAL: Fix circular dependency causing memory exhaustion
3. ✅ HIGH: Fix missing dependencies in wpmatch.php
4. ✅ HIGH: Initialize missing components 
5. ✅ MEDIUM: Check nonce setup for admin JS
6. ✅ MEDIUM: Verify database initialization order

## ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED! ✅

The plugin should now activate without memory exhaustion errors, translation loading warnings, and have all required dependencies loaded and components properly initialized.
